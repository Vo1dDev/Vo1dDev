## 🛠️ What I Do

I help maintain, clean up, and distribute public Skyblock QoL clients — especially those originally made for supporters.  
All builds I share are unlocked, tested, and updated regularly. No paid features. No nonsense.

## 🔓 Clients I Maintain

| Client Name        | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pizza Client**    | Fake rotation auras, nukers, macros, and a massive ESP suite               |
| **Oringo Client**   | Skill, slayer, and dungeon automation — with UI customizations and helpers |
| **Cheeto Client**   | Visual-heavy mod with stealth patching, entity ESP, and dungeon tweaks     |
| **Funnymaps Extras**| Enhanced version of Funnymap with better overlays, config, and ESP logic   |

All are built for **Forge 1.8.9**, optimized for Hypixel Skyblock, and regularly updated.
